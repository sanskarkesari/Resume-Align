## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Resume Preprocessing**:
   Cleans raw resume data using regex, removing special characters, URLs, and stopwords.

2. **Information Extraction**:
   Extracts structured data like skills using NLP-based named entity recognition and rule-based patterns.

3. **Job Category Matching**:
   Matches resume content to predefined job categories using cosine similarity and rule-based matching.

4. **Ranking Candidates**:
   Applies a scoring formula to rank candidates based on skill match, experience, and certifications.

5. **Visualization**:
   Generates word clouds and skill distribution graphs for better interpretation.
